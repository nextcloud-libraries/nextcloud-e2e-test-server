[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/nextcloud-libraries/nextcloud-e2e-test-server)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/nextcloud-libraries/nextcloud-e2e-test-server) [![npm last version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@nextcloud/e2e-test-server.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nextcloud/e2e-test-server) ![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/nextcloud/nextcloud-e2e-test-server?style=flat-square)

Nextcloud e2e test server and utils for cypress and playwright.

## Status

This package is currently work in progress and will change significantly until version 1.0.
In particular cypress specific utils such as selectors will be dropped unless they are widely used.

## Starting Nextcloud Docker container

### Playwright

1. Copy `playwright.config.mjs` and `playwright` folder from this repository!
2. Add the `@playwright/test` dependency:
  ```
    npm install --save-dev '@playwright/test'
  ```
3. Add the `start:nextcloud` script to your package.json
  ```json
    {
      "start:nextcloud": "node playwright/start-nextcloud-server.mjs",
    }
  ```
4. Install chromium for playwright:
  ```
    npx playwright install chromium --only-shell
  ```
5. Run playwright tests:
  ```
    npx playwright test
  ```
6. Add `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` to your repository!
7. Write your own tests!



### Cypress

You can use the `cypress` folder and the `cypress.config.ts` in this repository as starting points or adjust your `cypress.config.ts` (or `.js`):

```js
import { configureNextcloud,  startNextcloud,  stopNextcloud, waitOnNextcloud } from '@nextcloud/e2e-test-server'

export default defineConfig({
// ...
	e2e: {
		// other configuration

		setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
			// Remove container after run
			on('after:run', () => {
				stopNextcloud()
			})

			// starting Nextcloud testing container with specified server branch
			return startNextcloud(process.env.BRANCH)
				.then((ip) => {
					// Setting container's IP as base Url
					config.baseUrl = `http://${ip}/index.php`
					return ip
				})
				.then(waitOnNextcloud)
				// configure Nextcloud, also install and enable the `viewer` app
				.then(() => configureNextcloud(['viewer']))
				.then(() => {
					return config
				})
		},
	},
})
```

## Getting the server log

The server's `data` directory is mounted as a tmpfs and the container is removed after the run,
so `data/nextcloud.log` is gone once the tests have finished.
To keep it, save it while the container still exists — either by passing `saveLogTo` to `stopNextcloud`,
or by setting the `NEXTCLOUD_E2E_LOG_FILE` environment variable (both take a path on your machine, relative paths are resolved from the current working directory):

```js
import { stopNextcloud } from '@nextcloud/e2e-test-server'

// Writes `data/nextcloud.log` to `cypress/logs/nextcloud.log`, then removes the container
await stopNextcloud({ saveLogTo: 'cypress/logs/nextcloud.log' })
```

If you need the log during a run — e.g. to attach it to a failing test — use `getNextcloudLog()`,
which resolves with the log contents, or `saveNextcloudLog(path)` to write it out.

```js
import { getNextcloudLog } from '@nextcloud/e2e-test-server'

const log = await getNextcloudLog()
```

## Cypress commands

You can import individual commands or all at once
You can find [the list of all available commands here](https://nextcloud.github.io/nextcloud-e2e-test-server/modules/commands.html) 

```js
// cypress/support/commands.js
import { addCommands } from '@nextcloud/e2e-test-server/cypress'

addCommands()
```

```js
// cypress/support/commands.js
import { login } from '@nextcloud/e2e-test-server/commands'

Cypress.Commands.add('login', login)
```

## Selectors (:warn: deprecated)

You can find [the list of all available selectors here](https://nextcloud.github.io/nextcloud-e2e-test-server/modules/selectors.html) 

```js
import { UploadPicker as UploadPickerComponent} from '../../dist/index.js'
import { UploadPicker, UploadPickerInput } from '@nextcloud/e2e-test-server/selectors'

describe('UploadPicker rendering', () => {
	it('Renders default UploadPicker', () => {
		cy.mount(UploadPickerComponent)
		cy.getNc(UploadPicker).should('exist')
			.should('have.class', 'upload-picker')
		cy.getNc(UploadPickerInput).should('exist')
	})
})
```
